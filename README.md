# Calculator

This project is a on-screen calculator using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. The skills I've demonstrated through this project is the use of DOM manipulation by adding Event listeners to HTML elements that were queried using DOM methods for clicking events and the DOM for keypressing events, CSS Flexbox to center the content of the elements vertically and horizontally and CSS Grid to make the calculator design.
